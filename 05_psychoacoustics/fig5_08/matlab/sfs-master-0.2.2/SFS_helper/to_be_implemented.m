function to_be_implemented(mfile)
%TO_BE_IMPLEMENTED indicates that the code had to be implemented
%
%   Usage: to_be_implemented([mfilename])
%
%   Input parameters:
%       mfilename   - string containing the name of the calling m file.
%                   NOTE: this variable is already avaiable in all m files as
%                   mfilename!
%
%   TO_BE_IMPLEMENTED(mfilename) results in an error that indicates the desired
%   code functionality has to be implemented yet.
