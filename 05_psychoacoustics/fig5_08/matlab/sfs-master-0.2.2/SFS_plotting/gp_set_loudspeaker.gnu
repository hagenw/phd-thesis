#gp_set_loudspeaker sets a loudspeaker as an gnuplot object
#   Usage: call 'gp_set_loudspeaker.gnu' 'x0' 'y0' 'phi' 'activity' 'lssize'
#
#   Input parameters:
#       x0, y0      - loudspeaker position
#       phi         - orientation of the loudspeaker
#       activity    - activity of the loudspeaker (0..1)
#       lssize      - size of the loudspeaker
#
#   gp_set_loudspeaker sets a single gnuplot object in the
#   form of a loudspeaker at the given position and for the given orientation.
#   The activity gives the color of the speaker ranging from 0 (white) to 1
#   (gray). This file is run in the loop gp_draw_loudspeakers.
#   For every added loudspeaker the global variable object_number is counted one
#   up and is accessable in your gnuplot code.
#
#   see also: gp_draw_loudspeakers, gp_set_head
