#gp_draw_loudspeakers adds loudspeaker after their positions given in a file
#
#   Usage: call 'gp_draw_loudspeakers.gnu' 'pos_file.txt' ['lssize']
#
#   Input parameters:
#       file    - file in which the positions of the loudspeaker are stored. The
#                 file has to had the following columns: x0, y0, phi, activity
#       lssize  - optional argument given the overall size of the loudspeaker.
#                 The default size is 0.1
#
#   gp_draw_loudspeakers adds a bunch of loudspeakers to your plot. The
#   number of speakers depends on the lines given in the file and places them
#   accordingly to the x0, y0 coordinates. phi gives the rotation of the speaker
#   and activity the color ranging from white (0) to gray (1).
