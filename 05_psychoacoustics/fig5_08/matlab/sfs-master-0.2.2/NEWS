Changes in the Sound Field Synthesis-Toolbox. Recent changes on top.

0.2.2 (27 November 2012)

    - added functions to calculate the sound pressure for monochromatic WFS at a
      single point in analogy to the point_source function
    - changed the behavior of secondary_source_selection to returning a new x0
      vector
    - added compatibility for octave 3.6
    - first fix of secondary source selection for focused sources (now they
      point always in the direction of the reference point) 

0.2.1 (15 June 2012)
    
    - added NFCHOA 2.5D monochromatic
    - added NFCHOA 2.5D binaural simulations
    - added SDM 2.5D monochromatic
    - make NFCHOA work under Octave
    - fixed direction of plane waves and point sources for NFCHOA time domain
      simulations
    - changed syntax for wave_field_* and driving_* functions:
        xs,f,src => xs,src,f
        xs,L,src => xs,src,L
        xs,L,f,src => xs,src,f,L

0.2.0 (25 April 2012)

    - first public release (under the GPLv3+ license)
