Perceptual Assessment of Sound Field Synthesis
==========

This repository includes the published version (not published yet) of the
following PhD-thesis:

Hagen Wierstorf - Perceptual Assessment of Sound Field Synthesis

Besides this the corresponding code for all the figures presented in the thesis
is provided in order to enable reproducibility of them for everyone. The
corresponding code is spread in different directories regarding the chapter and
figure number. In order to run the code you will need the external toolboxes
mentioned below and Matlab or Octave. Some of the code runs only in Octave at
the moment, but it should be easily adoptable to Matlab. A README in the
corresponding directory is indicating those cases.

## Requirements

Sound Field Synthesis Toolbox https://github.com/sfstoolbox/sfs (commit 3730bc0)  
Auditory Modelling Toolbox http://amtoolbox.sourceforge.net/ (commit aed0198)
