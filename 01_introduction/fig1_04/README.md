**Figure 1.4**: Loudspeaker setups for two
channel stereophony and sound field
synthesis. The area marked in blue
describes the positions were the listener can move to and still perceives the
same spatial impression. This area is
smaller for stereophonic setups and is
called the sweet-spot. The figure of the
stereophony setup is a modified version
of J. Ahrens. Analytic Methods of Sound
Field Synthesis. New York: Springer,
2012, Fig. 1.1.
