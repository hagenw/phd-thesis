# FIGURE 1.1: The human auditory system. The two ear signals are processed by
# the outer, middle, and inner ear. In the inner ear they are transformed into
# neuronal signals which are then analyzed at different interlinked stations
# in the brain. The interlinking of both ear signals already happens at a low
# level in the brainstem. In the brain itself a representation of the external
# ear signals in the form of an auditory scene is the final stage. This figure
# is based on B. Grothe, M. Pecka, and D. McAlpine. "Mechanisms of Sound
# Localization in Mammals". Physiological Reviews 90 (2010), pp. 983â€“1012; K.
# Talbot et al. "Synaptic dysbindin-1 reductions in schizophrenia occur in an
# isoform-specific manner indicating their subsynaptic location." PLoS ONE 6.3
# (2011), e16886; L. Chittka and A.  Brockmann. "Perception space--the final
# frontier." PLoS Biology 3.4 (2005), e137.
