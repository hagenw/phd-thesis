    "The impulse responses representing the different WFS systems in the coloration experiment were all created using integer delays. This added a few distortions for high frequencies, which are observeable in Fig. 5.8 as the slight ripples in the spectra for the conditions with an inter-loudspeaker distance of 0.5 cm and 0.3 cm. We repeated the experiment by using a fractional delay method and a sampling rate of 48 kHz which ensured that the delay line had a flat frequency response in the region up to 44.1 kHz. Now the frequency response for the WFS system with an inter-loudspeaker distance of 1 cm showed a flat frequncy response. The same holds for the results of the listening test presented in Fig. 5.10. In the repeated listening test, the conditions for 1 cm and 2 cm are no longer different from the reference condition.\n",
