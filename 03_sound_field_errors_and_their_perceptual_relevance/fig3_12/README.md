**Figure 3.12**: Sound pressure in decibel of a plane wave synthesized by
NFC-HOA (2.45) and WFS (2.55). Mono-frequent simulations were done for all
frequencies at three different listening positions. A fixed offset was added to
the amplitudes for two of the positions for better visualization.  Parameters:
n_k = (0,âˆ’1,0), x_ref = (0,0,0) m, circular secondary source distribution with a
diameter of 3 m.

## Steps for reproduction

Matlab/Octave:
```Matlab
>> fig3_12
```
Note that the calculation will take several hours.

Bash:
```Bash
$ gnuplot fig3_12.plt
```
