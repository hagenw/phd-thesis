**Figure 3.17**: ITDs for a pink noise signal synthesized as a point source by
NFC-HOA (2.45) and WFS (2.57) at three listening positions, with a head
orientation of 90Â°. Parameters: x_s = (0,2.5,0), x_ref = (0,0,0), circular
secondary source distribution with a diameter of 3 m.

## Errata

With [release 2.4.0] of the SFS Toolbox for Matlab the numerical problems
apparent in the above figure could be resolved ([code to reproduce this
figure]). 

![Fig 3.17](fig3_17_errata.png)

[release 2.4.0]: http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.846583
[code to reproduce this figure]: https://github.com/hagenw/phd-thesis/tree/sfs-2.4/03_sound_field_errors_and_their_perceptual_relevance/fig3_17

## Steps for reproduction

Matlab/Octave:
```Matlab
>> fig3_17
```

Bash:
```Bash
$ gnuplot fig3_17.plt
```

## Problem solving

If you run the above command in Octave it could happen that you get an error
like
```
error: zp2sos: A(I,J): row index out of bounds; value 1 out of bound 0
```
This happens if you have a new version of the `zp2sos` Octave Forge function
installed. The problem was introduced with [commit
f248ba](http://sourceforge.net/p/octave/signal/ci/f248ba3244150e69e576d898161d8a0a8892b7c3/).
This error can be solved if you change line 106 in
`driving_function_imp_nfchoa_ps.m` of the Sound Field Synthesis Toolbox from
```Matlab
sos = zp2sos(z*c/r,z*c/R,1,'up','none');
```
to
```Matlab
[sos,~] = zp2sos(z*c/r,z*c/R,1,'up','none');
```
