**Figure 3.16**: Sound pressure of a cosine shaped impulse synthesized as
focused source by WFS (2.76) at three listening positions. A fixed offset was
added to the sound pressure at two listening positions for a better
visualization. Parameters: x_s = (0,0.5,0) m, n_s = (0,âˆ’1,0), circular secondary
source distribution with a diameter of 3 m.
